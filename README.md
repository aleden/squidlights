squidlights
===========

Successor to squidnet. The name change is indicative of different operation.
Whereas squidnet is an RPC protocol for allowing multiple servers to
communicate with one another, squidlights is a non-distributed server for light
control in tEp. It uses OLA, the Open Lighting Architecture, to control light
fixtures all around the house. While currently only KiNET devices have been
added, squidlights can be configured to use many other serial protocols to
control [many types of devices] (https://www.openlighting.org/ola/).
